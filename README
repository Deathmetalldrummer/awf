Description:

A theme preview application for gtk2 and gtk3.



Features:

 - Display widget types available in gtk2/gtk3.

   Remark: Option menu widget type only exists in gtk2.
           Switch widget type only exists in gtk3.

 - Menus to select the available themes either at system level or user level.

 - Toolbar button to start the other gtk version of the tool.
