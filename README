Description:

A theme preview application for gtk2 and gtk3.

'A widget factory' is a theme preview application for gtk2 and gtk3.
It displays the various widget types provided by gtk2/gtk3 in a single window
allowing to see the final visual effect of the applied theme.



Features:

 - Display widget types available in gtk2/gtk3.

   Remark: Option menu widget type only exists in gtk2.
           Switch widget type only exists in gtk3.

 - Menus to select the available themes either at system level or user level.

 - Toolbar button to start the other gtk version of the tool.

 - Toolbar button to refresh the current theme.

   Remark: To allow gtk to refresh the theme, I had to temporarily switch 
           to another theme (Raleigh).
